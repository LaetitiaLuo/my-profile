          Hello ! My name is Laetitia Luo. I was born and raised in Paris, France. I'm currently a third-year student at ESSEC Global BBA. I love watching american tv shows.But I do also enjoy watching asian dramas like korean or chinese ones as long as the plotline is interesting I'm willing to give it a try. I like discovering new culture and new music.

        <h2>TV SHOWS üì∫</h2>
        <p>
          TV Shows are something I really enjoy watching when I'm at home or with my friends. I even have an application to keep track on what I watch called "TV Time" which allow me to know when my tv shows are airing a new episode or what was the last episode I watched. A really useful app if you watched a tons of tv shows, movies, anime and even variety shows. Personnally, I think tv shows enable people to fully immerse themselves into the characters and to for a moment forget about everything. Moreover, it creates a community of fans who share together on social medias their opinions about the last episode for example or their theories on what is going to happen in the season. And this is beautiful because the memories the fans and actors create together will leave a legacy behind them even after the show is over.

        <h2>DANCE üíÉüèª</h2>
        <p>
          Since I was young, I always found dance really cool. I remembered the days when I would play "Just Dance" with my friends after school. Every year, everyone would buy the game and we would try beat each other's scores whenever we go to each other's houses. However, I no longer buy them because I don't have the time to play or see my friends as much as before. Moreover, I also used to go to dance classes but I stopped because I didn't have time to go. It was a period of my life, I won't forget because I truly discovered what dance was like since each month we would learn a different choregraphy with a different genre and I became friends with such nice people that I hope to continue being friends in the future. But I do enjoy learning choregraphies with youtube tutorials, even though sometimes it's hard at the end I think it's a good way to spend my time and to exercice.

        <h2>TRAVEL ‚úàÔ∏è</h2>
        <p>
          When I was young, I didn't really like the plane because everytime the plane took off off my ears would get clogged and I found the flight so long. Now that I'm older, I don't mind it as much as before. So far I traveled to Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, China & South Korea. The trips which I liked the most were Spain because I was with one of my best friends and only the two of us went there so it has let us become closer.The second one is probably South Korea and it was the most recent trip, I went there in 2019 with my sister. It's been a long time since I went somewhere on a trip outside China so it was for me really a trip I truly loved and had a lot of fun exploring and discovering a new culture. Finally, China because I went multiple times and it has allow me to rediscover again my origins. Plus, I was able to see my little cousins who I didn't see because they weren't born last time haha.
